The book price is about $12500 and the cheapest I can see on Carsales is $13000.\n\nI'll take $10000 before the end of the month so be quick.\n\nNo negotiating, if you want to pay $10k, drive it away.  If you're not prepared to pay $10k, walk away now.\n\nLow mileage for the year, i small prang on the rear (pictured) and a few scuffs here and there that you'd expect in a 7 year old car.\n\nCan is in St Ives, Sydney 2075 and can be viewed any day this week.  Any inspection welcome.\n\n2 keys, has been serviced locally.  Any questions drop me a line but as I said not responses to anything less than $10k.\n\nRego until 21st April 26 \n\nTake it or leave it.",

It has been completely torn apart. It then had the cylinders re honed brand new cams and heads. The list goes on.\nCosmetically it requires some work. The 2 front seats could be reupholstered. The front bumper needs to be resprayed and you are set to go. If you are looking for a perfect car this is not the car. It's also why it is incredibly cheap. I have priced the car appropriately.\nFeel free to message me for any further questions you have.",
